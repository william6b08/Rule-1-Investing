  <h2>Understand what the company is doing</h2>
  <p>
    It is important to understand what the company's future plan is in order to have a better understanding of its performance in a long run.
    One way to find out about this is by reading the 10-K company submitted to <strong><a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a></strong>.
    Enlisted companies are required to submit 10-K form every year to report their financial data of that fiscal year. In the section <strong><em>Business</em></strong>,
    company will provide a rundown of what kind of company it is, what they accomplished this year, acknowledgement of any challenges they are facing and future plan.
    All in all, 10-K is a great way to start your digging into the companies you want to invest into.
